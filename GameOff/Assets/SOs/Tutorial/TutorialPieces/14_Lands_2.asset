  _description: "Lands also destroy all enemies in the lane they\u2019re placed in.
    After you use a Land cliche and you draw a new hand, the cliche gets taken out
    of the deck. You won't be able to use it again until the next enemy wave. Additionally,
    lands disappear at the end of the wave.\r"
